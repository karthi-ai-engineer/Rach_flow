"""Speech recognition by a cloud provider (OpenAI, Groq, Google Gemini) with the user's own key, or by the user's own
server (vLLM, a company AI gateway, any server with OpenAI's transcription API).

The voice is sent to the provider: the window asks before a cloud model is used. OpenAI, Groq and own servers share
OpenAI's transcription API (a multipart upload of the recording); Gemini's Flash models get the recording inline in a
generateContent request, with an instruction to write down exactly what was said; Gemini 3's are asked to think as little
as they allow (sst.modelrules). Your words and the chosen language go along as hints.

Gemini Transcribe (gemini-3.5-transcribe), Google's dedicated speech-to-text model, gets no instruction: the recording
and an audioTranscriptionConfig. Always VERBATIM (fillers and false starts kept: the voice pipeline does its own
cleanup), with either word times ("timestamps", the default: merging overlapping chunks needs them) or Your words as
custom vocabulary ("vocabulary"): Google offers only one of the two at a time. A recording too big to send inline goes
through the Files API and is deleted afterwards. Whisper models (OpenAI's whisper-1, Groq's) give word times too.

Built never to lose a dictation: a connection is opened while the user speaks (prepare), the first-connection stall
seen on the dev laptop is retried with a short connect timeout, and when the provider can't be reached or fails, the
recording is transcribed on this computer instead (Parakeet), with a note saying so (`last_error`). A provider that
couldn't be reached is skipped for a minute, so being offline costs one wait, not one per dictation. The voice
pipeline's chunks (transcribe_chunk) never fall back here: the pipeline decides. They can be sent two or three at once,
each on a kept-alive connection of its own.
