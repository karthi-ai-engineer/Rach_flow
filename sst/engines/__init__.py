"""Speech recognition: the building block that turns the voice into text, chosen apart from the AI cleanup.

SPEECH_MODELS is the catalog the window shows: each model says where it runs, which languages it knows, its size and
what it is good at. `ready` models can be used in this version; the others are listed as coming next.

An engine has a `name` (its catalog key), a `title` (what reports call it), `transcribe(audio, sample_rate) -> str`,
and a `signature` (what its text depends on: sst.evaluate caches by it). Engines that can use the user's words have a
`words` list, which the app keeps up to date. To add one, create engines/<name>.py and list it below.

Cloud models (sst.engines.cloud) need the user's key for the provider, shared with AI cleanup (sst.gateway). A model on
the user's own server needs its address (GatewayConfig.speech_server).
