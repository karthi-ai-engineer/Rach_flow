"""Ready-made setups: a speech model and an AI model that go together, each the cheapest that does the job well.

Most people don't know which models to use (the owner, 2026-10-06). A setup chooses both parts at once: Recommended,
Fastest, Multilingual, Local, or Custom (the user's own choice of each part). The ids and the estimates come from the
research notes "Rflow model costs and setups" (2026-10-06); sst.costs holds the prices.

  Recommended   Parakeet on this PC                 + Gemini gemini-3.5-flash-lite   a Gemini key   ~$1 a month
  Fastest       Groq whisper-large-v3-turbo          + Groq openai/gpt-oss-20b        a Groq key     ~$0.70
  Multilingual  Gemini gemini-3.5-transcribe         + Gemini gemini-3.5-flash-lite   a Gemini key   ~$3.60
  Local         Parakeet or Whisper on this PC       + AI cleanup off (a model on this PC comes later)   free

No Qt here: apply() works on the TrayApp (sst.app), or the window's PreviewApp, through the same calls the pages use.
A setup's key is saved before (TrayApp.save_key, which changes nothing else); apply() then sets the two parts.
