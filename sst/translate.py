"""Translate (the owner's idea of 2026-10-02, like DeepL): copy text with Ctrl+C+C and read it in another language.

The AI cleanup's model translates under a strict prompt: a translator, never an assistant. Questions and requests in the
text are translated, not answered; names, numbers, amounts, dates, emails, links and code stay as written. Text that is
already in the chosen language goes to the user's second language instead ("English, or Japanese when it's English").
check() looks for the values that must survive (digits, emails, links): a missing one is shown as a warning beside the
translation, which the user reads before using it, so nothing is refused.
