"""The live pipeline's contracts: its settings, and the events every engine produces.

Every engine (Gemini Live Translate now; a streaming recognizer with a clause translator later) turns audio frames into
the same stream of events, so the caption bar, the transcript and the measurements are written once:

    SOURCE      the words heard in the current line so far (they may still change)
    TRANSLATION its translation so far (may still change)
    LINE        the line is finished: its source and translation are final, and the next line starts
    STATUS      connecting, listening, reconnecting, stopped
    ERROR       something went wrong; the text says what, in plain words
