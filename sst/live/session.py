"""One live captions session: one or two ways (lanes), each a capture feeding its own engine, and their events going to
one transcript, the log and whoever shows them (the caption bar). Qt-free: the app moves the events to its own thread.

    SYSTEM  what the laptop plays (a meeting, a video)       -> target
    MIC     what the microphone hears (the room, or the user)  -> mic_target (Japanese)

The microphone's lines that come back untranslated (speech already in mic_target) depend on the source. With Both they
are dropped, never shown or saved: they are the meeting's own words from the speakers when there are no headphones
(echo, already shown and translated by the SYSTEM way), or the user speaking the language their words are translated
into, which the bar never shows for the user anyway (it shows the user's lines by their translation only). With the
microphone alone they are the room's words: shown and saved as heard (the bar marks them as already in the target
language), never spoken, since the voice says translations only.

While a way has shown no words, the bar's status line says why (NOTE events), from the levels of the frames it hears:

    the engine listens                                   -> "Listening…"
    the last LiveConfig.note_after_s s: sound, no words  -> "Hearing sound, but no speech yet"
                                        near silence     -> "Nothing heard yet: is the sound playing on this laptop?"
                                                            (the microphone: "Nothing heard from the microphone")
    words come                                           -> cleared, for good
    microphone alone, lines already in its language      -> "You're speaking English, …" until a line is translated

With Both the microphone says nothing of its own silence: the user listening is silent. note(lane, message) shows
something a capture found out instead (a device with no sound on it), until words come.

With speaking on, the translation also goes to a Speaker (sst.live.speaker), and a way that could hear the voice gets
silence while it speaks: the microphone near speakers (not headphones), and what the laptop plays where Windows can't
leave Rflow's own sound out (before Windows 11). So the spoken translation is never heard and translated again.
