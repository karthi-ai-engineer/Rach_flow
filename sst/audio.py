"""Microphone recording and WAV read/write.

Capture goes through WASAPI, Windows' own audio interface, at the microphone's own rate (the speech engine resamples):
the old MME interface reports 44.1 kHz for every microphone and resamples silently, which hid that a Bluetooth headset
only delivers call-quality audio. A microphone can be kept open ("warm") for a while after a dictation: opening one
takes about 0.4 s, which cut off first words, and a warm one also keeps the moment before the key press.

Microphones come and go (a headset plugged in, a Bluetooth one connecting, a new Windows default). PortAudio knows only
the devices it found when it started, and restarting it closes every open stream, so Rflow asks Windows (sst.devices)
what exists, and when that changed, refresh_devices() closes the open microphones, restarts PortAudio and opens them
again: between dictations, never during one. An open microphone that stops sending sound is opened again too.
