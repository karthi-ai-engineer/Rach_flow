"""Dictate into any app: put the cursor in a text box, press the hotkey, speak, and the text
is typed where the cursor is.

  hold the hotkey      record while held; let go to stop    (push-to-talk)
  tap the hotkey       start recording; tap again to stop   (hands-free)
  Ctrl+Win+Space       hands-free too, as in Wispr Flow
  Esc while recording  cancel, nothing is typed

`Dictation` holds the logic and is shared by the console command (`run` below), the tray app
(sst.app) and the tests. Transcription and typing run on a worker thread, so a new recording
can start right away.

With a voice pipeline (sst.pipeline.session.VoicePipeline), each recording is a session fed while the key is held:
chunks cut at pauses go to the speech engine while the user is still speaking, and after the key is let go only the
last chunk and the text stages (dictionary, formatting, LLM, guard) remain. Without one, the whole recording is
transcribed at once (the classic way, and the tests' fake recorders).
