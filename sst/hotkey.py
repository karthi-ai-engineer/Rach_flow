"""Global hotkeys on Windows through a low-level keyboard hook (the way Wispr Flow does it).

A hotkey is modifiers plus an optional key, or a double tap of Ctrl or Shift:
  ctrl+win     modifiers held together on their own    (default, like Wispr Flow)
  menu         the Menu key, next to right Alt         its right-click menu is blocked
  ctrl+alt+d   modifiers + a key                       the key is blocked, the modifiers pass through
  double ctrl  Ctrl tapped twice quickly, on its own   Ctrl passes through: alone it does nothing in apps
  ctrl+c+c     Ctrl+C pressed twice quickly            nothing is blocked: the app copies as usual (the translator)

The hook runs on its own thread and reports "press", "release", "cancel" (Esc while recording),
"handsfree" (Space added to a modifier-only hotkey: Ctrl+Win+Space, as in Wispr Flow) and "interrupt"
(any other key added, e.g. Ctrl+Win+D: a Windows shortcut, not dictation) on a queue. A double tap has no "press":
it reports "release" as the second tap is let go.

While a menu that must not take the keyboard focus is open (Text Transform's, so the app keeps its selection), the
listener can capture keys: their presses are hidden from every app and reported as "key:<virtual-key code>".
