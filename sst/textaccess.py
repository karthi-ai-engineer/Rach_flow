"""Read and replace the text selected in whichever app has keyboard focus (Text Transform).

Apps don't share their text with other programs in one common way, so this does what the user would do: Ctrl+C copies
the selection, Shift+Left selects what Rflow has just typed, and Ctrl+V pastes the result over the selection, as
formatted HTML too for the editors that take it. The user's clipboard is put back every time, except by set_clipboard:
when the result can't go back where the text was, it is left on the clipboard for the user to paste.

Every Windows call sits behind a small module-level function, so the tests replace them with fakes.
