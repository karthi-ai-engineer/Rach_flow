"""Text Transform: on request, rewrite text the user already has (selected, or the last dictation) as Concise, Professional,
Bullet points, Action items or a clearer Rewrite (the owner's idea of 2026-10-02: speak normally first, transform after);
since phase 40 also Fix grammar, a Japanese Teams message, a Japanese internal or external email (from Japanese or English
text), and Translate in place (research_notes "Rflow Text Transform expansion").

A model does the writing (`Transformer`, through any `complete(system_prompt, text)`), under strict rules (`system_prompt`):
a writing tool that invents nothing and loses nothing protected. It never grades its own work: `TransformGuard` compares the
original and the result deterministically, with the dictation guard's readers (sst.pipeline.guard: values, self-corrections,
questions, stems), and any doubt rejects, because the fallback, the user's own text, is always safe. A rejection gets one
repair attempt that names the problems; a second one keeps the original. `render` turns the light markdown the model writes
(**Heading** lines, "- " bullets) into the plain text and the HTML fragment that replace the selection.

Unlike the dictation guard, a transform may reword freely (Professional) and drop words (Concise): what is checked is what
must survive any wording, i.e. values, names, negations, uncertainty, conditions, choices, qualifiers and questions, and
what must never appear, i.e. new values, new names, sentences of new content, a reply instead of the text. Japanese text and
the transforms that write in another language are checked by what survives a change of language (_Across).
